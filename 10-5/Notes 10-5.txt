Recall
    CSS goes from top to bottom
    we can use selectors
CSS units
    pixels, inches, cm, mm
Relative units
    % (relative to parent element)
    em(relative to font size of element)
    rem(relative to font size of root element)
Viewports: phone vs tablet vs...
CSS Colors
    names, RBG, hex, etc.
CSS Overriding
    what happens when a property is written twice?
        the second descriptor will be executed
Exclamation mark enter
Ctrl space (autocomplete)
Combining selectors
CSS Specificity
    The selector with the highest specificity value will "win"
Being more specific
    To universal naming convention
    Use dash case or camel case for naming
Advanced CSS

Position elements

    relative (default, relative parent and siblings)
    sticky (ex: nav bars)

CSS transition
    values that change over time
    four descriptor: property, duration, timing (linear, ease, etc.) initial delay (optional)
Keyframes animation
