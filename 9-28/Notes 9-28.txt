What goes in head? Metadata, tab icon image, wont be shown on the page, title, extra
    files to link to page: CSS, JS, Etc. 
             body? Stuff that will be shown on the page: headers, paragraphs, hyperlinks, etc.
By default, the browser will ignore any extra space: new lines, space

Paragraphs. just basic text, no different than without it, used for containing text only
    double tags

Break tag (new line)
    <br> creates a new line on the page

<pre> tag doesn't format text. yes has closing tag

tags you should know:
header: makes text bigger and bold, h1 is biggest, h6 smalest
title: describes title of webpage, goes inside head tag, seen on page's tab, won't show up on content
span vs. div: span takes up as much space as its children, used for containing words in webpage
div: takes up as much space as its parent, used for dividing sections of content in page
both used to "wrap" elements

<img> element: contains a "src" attribute that is link to image

LETS GET STYLISH (CSS)
    plain HTML text looks ugly
    CSS lets us style our pages
    stands for cascading style sheets
    an extension of html
3 ways to style
    <style> element
    <style> attribute
    CSS file (standard option)
    best pratice is to put CSS all in one file
CSS basics
    we use descriptors to alter an element's property
    property: value;
    all separated by semicolons
CSS selectors
    to describe, we must first "select" using:
    p element selectors
    * universe selectors
    p, div, span, combination selectors
    selector{
        property: value;
        property: value;
    }
ID, classes, elements
    set 'id' or 'class' attribute using quotation mark
    in a stylesheet or style element: # id or .class or element; set the properties in curly brackets
Element boundaries
    bounding box
    rectangles
    default size is subjective to: 
        inline: children/content/children
        block: parent
    All elements have width and height
